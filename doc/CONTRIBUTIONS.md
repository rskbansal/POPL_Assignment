## Why the split was done in this fashion?
- Rhythm had previous experiences with Flask and Gunicorn, so he was the best fit to make the API endpoint & host a local server for the same.
- Devansh had previous experiences with Python, so he was the best fit to make the Python implementation of the client.
- Kinshuk is proficient with Rust, so he was able to to make the Rust implementation of the client.
